ReactJS - Overview:
===================

A JS library used to create user interfaces
The 'V' in MVC
React can be run on both the client & the server(NodeJs and Express, react can be run here also)

Virtual DOM
-----------
React creates a slimmer version of the DOM and updates only the parts that need to be re-rendered
It's faster
One way reactive data flow(one way data-binding)

Why use react?
--------------
Simple
Declarative
Readable & Reusable

JSX: JavaScript Syntax Extension
--------------------------------
- A tag syntax very similar to XML & HTML
- Not required but recommended (Makes things MUCH easier)

Babel JavaScript Compiler
-------------------------
- Transforms JSX code into JS
- Lets us write code that uses the ES6(ES2015) syntax
- Babel works very well with Webpack which is a module bundler and also has a dev server
- <script type="text/babel">

var HelloMessage = React.createClass({
	render:function() {
		return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
	}
});

ReactDOM.render(
	<HelloMessage name="Rajasekhar"/>,
	Document.getElementById('app')
);

States & Props
--------------
- Components can hold properties(props) that can be passed in as attributes
- Components can maintain internal "state" data
- When a state is changed, the component is re-rendered and markup will be updated. This makes React very dynamic

Lifecycle Methods
-----------------
React fires off specific methods when a component is rendered or updated
* render - Renders a component. The only one that is required
* getInitialState - You can set default values for your states
* getDefaultProps - Set defaults for properties
* componentWillMount - Invoked once on client & server before render
* componentDidMount - Invoked after the first render

React Addons
------------
- Collection of modules that aid in developing react.js applications
- Animation Addons
- 2 way data binding addons - React Link
- Testing Addons
